This is an simple budgeting App. The Application is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript(ES5). 

It can be used to calculate the budget in terms income and expenses. This keep track of the expenses and also presesnt the percentage 
income spent (total as well as individually). 

The HTML, CSS and JS file are separately written in respective extensions. The JS code is modular and elagant.
